# Instant Messaging System with FAST UDP File Transfer

## Overview

This project features an instant messaging system with a server and clients that communicate using TCP, allowing for seamless sending and receiving of messages between clients through the server. Additionally, we have implemented a FAST layer for file transfer over UDP to enhance the speed and reliability of file transfers.

## Key Features

* **Instant Messaging System:**
  * **Server and Clients:** Communicate via TCP, enabling real-time message exchange.
  * **Message Handling:** Efficient management of sending and receiving messages between clients.

* **FAST UDP File Transfer:**
  * **Reliable Transfer:** Improved reliability through ACK mechanisms to manage packet loss.
  * **Optimized Speed:** Enhanced transfer speed with appropriate packet size planning and the Windowing Protocol.
